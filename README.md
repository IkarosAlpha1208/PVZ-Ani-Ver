This is Gr.12 ISU Assignment for david and hamse

Something to note:
you can create new player save by deleing the existing one or just move away
scoreboard is pretty much useless, it just records the highest score you've got and from before
the default save file that you will be starting with is a file wtih all the plant unlocked and you have 2 of them
Error:
Sometime there will be ConcurrentModificationException, i dont know how to fix it so i just catch it and leave it there
There is a bug where zombie are spawned but not coming out, and the level cannot continue because you cant kill these zombies
